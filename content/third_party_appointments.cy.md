# Attending an appointment on behalf of a family member or friend

If you would like to discuss the pension options of a family member, friend or
someone else, we will need to obtain verbal or written consent from the person
whose pension payments will be discussed.

If you have a power of attorney covering property and financial affairs, a copy
will be requested in order to adhere with data protection requirements.

Phone **0800 138 3944** to speak to someone who can help book your free
appointment.
