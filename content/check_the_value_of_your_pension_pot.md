#Check the value of your pension pot

If you’re unsure how much you’ve got in your whole pension pot, or how many pots you’ve paid into, there are different ways to find out.

You can:

- contact your pension provider (the pension plan you paid into)
- look at your recent pension statement - your provider should have sent you this once a year
- look at your ‘wake-up pack’ - this is the pack you got from your pension provider between 4 and 6 months before your agreed retirement age (usually between 60 and 65)

If you’re less than 4 months away from your retirement age and haven’t got a wake-up pack you should contact your pension provider.

You may have paid into more than one pension pot. You’ll need to contact each pension provider to find out the value of each one.

^You’ll probably need to know the total value of your pension pot if you want to [talk to an expert](/guidance-session) or get useful help on what to do with it.^

##Check which pensions schemes you’ve paid into
