# How to transfer a pension

^You may have to get financial advice before you’re able to transfer your pension.^

## Questions to ask your **current** provider:

- Can I transfer? (There can be restrictions on which pensions you can transfer)
- What is the ‘transfer value’ of my pension? (If it’s the same as your pot value, it’s unlikely you’ll be charged a fee when you transfer)
- What fees will I have to pay?
- Will I lose the right to take out my money at a certain age? (This is called ‘protected pension age’)
- Will I lose any special features, eg a guaranteed annuity rate? 
- Will I lose the right to take a tax-free lump sum of more than 25% of my pension? (This is called a ‘protected tax-free sum’)

You then need to shop around for a new provider to transfer your pension to.

## Questions to ask your **new** provider:

- Are there any fees for transferring in, eg set up fees?
- Do I have to make regular payments into the new pension?
- What investment funds and levels of risk do you offer? (You may need help from a financial adviser with this)
- Do I need to get financial advice before I can transfer?
- What options do you have for when I want to take my money out?
- How do I transfer? Do I apply through you or through my current provider?

You’ll need to complete an application form to request the transfer. If you’re transferring more than one pension you may have to complete more than one application. 

## Getting financial advice

You must get financial advice before you transfer from a:

- defined benefit pension worth more than £30,000
- defined contribution pension worth more than £30,000 with a guarantee about what you’ll be paid when you retire (eg a guaranteed annuity rate) 

Your provider can’t carry out the transfer without proof that you’ve had financial advice.
