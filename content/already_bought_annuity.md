# If you’ve already bought an annuity

Annuity rules will change in 2017. You may then be able to sell an existing annuity and use the money to get a lump sum or an [adjustable income](/adjustable-income).

Under current rules, once you’ve bought an annuity you can’t change the decision.

An annuity provides a guaranteed income for a fixed number of years or the rest of your life. If you already have one, you may decide the best option is to keep it.

^Selling an annuity is a big decision and you should think carefully about it. You might want to speak to a [financial adviser](/financial-advice) before you make a decision.^
