# Contact us

Email Pension Wise at <contact@pensionwise.gov.uk>. We'll soon have an address for you to write to us by post.

If you’d like to speak to a guidance specialist about your pension options, you can [book an appointment](/appointments).

## Complaints

If you have a complaint about Pension Wise, you can email us at <complaints@pensionwise.gov.uk>.

If your complaint is about:

- a phone guidance appointment - include your booking reference number (you'll find this in your confirmation email)

- a face-to-face guidance appointment - include the date, time and location of your appointment

^Read our guide if you want to [complain about a pension or pension provider](/pension-complaints).^

We'll let you know when we've received your complaint and aim to give a full response within 20 working days.

If we can't do this (eg, if we need more time to investigate your complaint) we'll let you know the reason for the delay and when you can expect a response.

### If you need to take things further

If you're not satisfied with our response to your complaint, you can write to <complaints@pensionwise.gov.uk> to get it escalated.

In your email, state the reason why you're unhappy with our first response and include copies of your original complaint and our response. HM Treasury will then investigate and get back to you within 20 working days.

### Getting more help

The [Adjudicator's Office](http://www.adjudicatorsoffice.gov.uk) is a free and impartial service that can investigate your complaint to see whether we've dealt with it in the right way.

^The Adjudicator will only look at your complaint after you've been through the full Pension Wise complaints process first. It can’t consider disputes about policy or legal matters.^

You'll need to send them a copy of your complaint as well as letters or emails that we sent in response. The Adjudicator usually won't look at a complaint received more than six months after the date of our final response.

You can also ask an MP to refer your complaint to the independent [Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO)](http://www.ombudsman.org.uk). You can [get help with finding your MP](http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/) if you don't know who they are. The Ombudsman usually only looks at complaints that the Adjudicator has already reviewed.
