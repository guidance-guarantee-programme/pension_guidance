# Tax you pay on your pension

When you take money from your pension pot, you pay tax on any income above your tax-free [Personal Allowance](https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates).

The amount of tax you pay depends on your total income for the year and your [tax rate](https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates).

^25% of what you take is tax-free – this money doesn’t use up any of your Personal Allowance.^

You could also be taxed on:

- your State Pension
- earnings from employment or self employment
- any other income, eg money from rental income, savings, investments
- any taxable benefits you might get, eg Carer’s Allowance

If you [leave your pot untouched](/leave-pot-untouched), you don’t pay Income Tax on it.

## What’s tax free

You can usually take 25% of your pot tax free. There are 2 ways you can do this.

### Take the 25% in one go

You can take 25% as a tax-free lump sum. 

If you do this, you can’t leave the remaining 75% untouched. You must either:

- buy a [guaranteed income (annuity)](/guaranteed-income)
- get an [adjustable income](/adjustable-income) 
- take the [whole pot](/take-whole-pot) as cash

You'll be taxed on this money.

$E
**Example** 
Your pot is £60,000 and you take £15,000 tax-free in one go. You buy an annuity with the remaining £45,000 which pays you £2,000 a year. This money is taxable.

### Take the 25% in chunks

You can take smaller cash sums from your pot – 25% of each chunk is tax-free.

$E
**Example** 
Your pot is £60,000 and you take £1,000 every month. £250 of this amount is tax-free every time. The remaining £750 is taxable.

## How your tax is paid

Money you take from your pot comes from your provider with the tax already taken off. 

Your provider will also take off any tax due on your State Pension.

### When you stop working

You may pay emergency tax when you take money from your pot. You can [claim this back](https://www.gov.uk/claim-tax-refund/you-get-a-pension) from HM Revenue and Customs.

### If you continue to work

Your employer will take any tax you owe off your earnings and your State Pension. This is called Pay As You Earn (PAYE). 

If your total income (including money from pensions and PAYE) is £100,000 or more for the tax year, or if you’re self-employed, you’ll have to fill in a [Self-Assessment tax return](https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-tax-returns).

### If you have other income

You’re responsible for paying tax on other income you have, eg from property or investments, and you might have to fill in a Self-Assessment tax return.

### Lifetime allowance

You pay tax on any amount in your pot above your [lifetime allowance](https://www.gov.uk/tax-on-your-private-pension/lifetime-allowance) of £1.25 million (£1 million from 6 April 2016).

## Pension recycling

If you take a tax-free lump sum from your pot and you pay into the same or another pot, it’s known as ‘pension recycling’.

You may have to pay 55% tax on the whole tax-free lump sum, even if you only recycle some of the money.

Get [financial advice](https://www.pensionwise.gov.uk/financial-advice) if you’re thinking of increasing your pension contributions at the same time as taking a lump sum.
