# Ill health and pensions

## If you’re ill

You may be able to take your pension pot early if you can’t work because you’re too ill.

This could be before you’re 55 or your ‘selected retirement age’ – the age you agreed with your provider to retire.

Speak to your provider about the rules of your pension – it will depend on their definition of ‘ill health’.

^An ‘enhanced’ or ‘impaired’ annuity may pay more than a standard annuity if you smoke or have a medical condition, eg diabetes or high blood pressure.^

## If you’re seriously ill

Special tax rules apply if you have a serious illness which means you’re expected to live for less than a year.

You may be able to take your whole pension pot tax free if **all** of the following apply to you:

- You’re expected to live for less than a year because of serious illness.
- You’re under 75 (if you’re over 75 you pay Income Tax on the lump sum).
- You don’t have more than the lifetime allowance of £1 million in pension money.

Check the terms of your pension with your provider. Some pensions will keep at least 50% of your pot for your spouse or partner.

You’ll need to think about whether you want a cash sum now or a type of income. You’ll also need to think about how you want to [leave money behind](/en/when-you-die).
