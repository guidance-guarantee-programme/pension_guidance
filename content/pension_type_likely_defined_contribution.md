# It’s likely you have a defined contribution pension

These are sometimes known as ‘money purchase’ pensions. The amount you get depends on how much was paid in and how well the investments have done.

There are different ways you can take your defined contribution pension pot. You can book a free [Pension Wise appointment](/appointments) to find out more.

^You can also [check another pension](pension-types).^
