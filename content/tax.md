# Tax you pay on your pension

When you take money from your pension pot 25% is tax free. This doesn’t use up any of your tax-free Personal Allowance. The standard allowance is £10,600.

You pay Income Tax on the other 75%. The amount you pay depends on your total income for the year and your tax rate.

## How each pension option is taxed

This table gives an overview of how much tax you may pay on the money you take from your pension pot.

## Other tax you could pay

You could also pay Income Tax on:
- your State Pension
- earnings from employment or self employment
- any other income, eg money from rental income, savings, investments
- any taxable benefits you might get, eg Carer’s Allowance

^You usually pay tax if your pension pots are worth more than the lifetime allowance. This is currently £1.25 million (£1 million from 6 April 2016).^

## The 25% tax-free amount

There are 2 ways you can take your tax-free amount.

### Take it in one go

You can take 25% as a lump sum without paying tax. If you do this, you can’t leave the remaining 75% untouched. You must either:

- buy a guaranteed income (annuity)
- get an adjustable income (flexi-access drawdown)
- take the whole pot as cash

$E
**Example**
Your pot is £60,000 and you take £15,000 – this is your tax-free lump sum. You buy an annuity with the remaining £45,000 which pays you £2,000 a year. This money is taxable.
$E

### Take it in chunks

You can take smaller cash sums from your pot without paying tax. 25% of each chunk is tax-free.

$E
**Example**
Your pot is £60,000 and you take £1,000 every month – £250 of this is tax-free. The remaining £750 is taxable.
$E

## How your tax is paid

Money you take from your pot comes from your provider with the tax already taken off.

Your provider will also take off any tax due on your State Pension.

You may pay emergency tax when you take money from your pot. You can [claim this back](https://www.gov.uk/claim-tax-refund/you-get-a-pension) from HM Revenue and Customs.

### If you continue to work

Your employer will take any tax you owe off your earnings and your State Pension. This is called Pay As You Earn (PAYE).

If your total income (including money from pensions and PAYE) is £100,000 or more for the tax year, or if you’re self-employed, you’ll have to fill in a [Self-Assessment tax return](https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-tax-returns).

### If you have other income

You’re responsible for paying tax on other income you have, eg from property or investments, and you might have to fill in a Self-Assessment tax return.

## Pension recycling

You need to be aware of ‘pension recycling’ tax laws if you plan to cash in one pot and pay into another. Get [financial advice](/financial-advice) if you’re thinking of doing this.
