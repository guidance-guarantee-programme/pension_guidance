# Find out your pension type

Use this service to:

- check your pension type
- find out if you can book a free Pension Wise appointment

If you have a defined contribution (personal or workplace) pension you choose how to take your money – you can then get free guidance about this from one of our pensions specialists.

^You’ll need to check each pension separately if you have more than one.^
