The way you take your [defined contribution pension](https://www.pensionwise.gov.uk/pension-types) may affect how much tax will be paid by the person you leave it to (your 'beneficiary’) when you die.

Most pension options allow anyone to inherit your pension. They don’t have to be a spouse or civil partner.


^Make sure your pension provider has up-to-date details for your beneficiary. If you have more than one pension, let all your providers know.^


##Leaving behind cash

If you take your tax-free lump sum but don’t use it before you die (eg it’s left in your bank account), it becomes part of your estate. Your estate is everything you own and all your money when you die. This means your beneficiary may need to pay [Inheritance Tax](https://www.gov.uk/inheritance-tax/overview) on it.

The same is true if you take all or part of your pot as cash and don't use it all before you die.

##Leaving behind a pension

When you die, if you have money still sitting in your pension pot, or if you're taking your pension as an [annuity](https://www.pensionwise.gov.uk/pension-pot-options#get-a-guaranteed-income-annuity) or as a flexible income ([flexi-access drawdown](https://www.pensionwise.gov.uk/pension-pot-options#get-a-flexible-income)), the following tax rules apply:


- your beneficiary will inherit your pension tax free if you die before 75
- your beneficiary will pay tax if you're 75 or over when you die


If you're 75 or over when you die, how much tax they pay depends on whether they take it as a single lump sum or use it to get a retirement income (as an annuity or flexi-access drawdown).

From April 2016, new tax rules apply for inheriting a pension from someone who dies at 75 or later.

###Using an inheritance to buy a pension

If you inherit a pension you can use the money to buy yourself an annuity or a flexi-access drawdown product. You still pay tax depending on the age of the person you inherited it from and on how you take the money.

##Money still in your pension pot

If you die before 75, money left in your pot is passed on tax free. Your beneficiary can take it a single lump sum or as a retirement income.

^If you die before 75, and you didn't touch the money in your pot at all, your beneficiary may have to pay tax if they don't use it within 2 years of the date your provider was told of your death.^

If you die at 75 or later, [this money is taxable](https://www.pensionwise.gov.uk/when-you-die#tax-at-a-glance). The tax your beneficiary pays depends on how and when they take the money.

##Annuities

If you take your pension as an annuity, you can only leave it to someone after you die if you’ve chosen one of the following types.

The payment your beneficiary gets depends on factors like their age and their health.

###Joint annuity

Payments are still made to your beneficiary after you die. (When they die they won’t be able to leave these payments to anyone else.)

###Guaranteed annuity

You fix the minimum number of years where payments are made after you die. The guarantee period starts the day you take money from your pot.

**Example:** You take a guaranteed 10-year annuity and die after 8 years, your spouse gets payments for another 2 years.
(If you die after 10 years you still get payments for the rest of your life, but your spouse won't get any payments after you die.)

###‘Capital protected’ annuity

Also known as a ‘value protected’ annuity. Your beneficiary inherits a lump sum: your pot minus any annuity payments you took before you died.

###Tax on annuities

If you're 75 or older when you die, [the payments your beneficiary gets are taxable](https://www.pensionwise.gov.uk/when-you-die#tax-at-a-glance). The tax they pay depends on how and when they take their payments.

##Flexi-access drawdown

If you take a flexible income through flexi-access drawdown, your beneficiary pays tax on this inheritance if you die at 75 or later.
