# What you can do with your pension pot

You can decide how to take the money from your pension pot when you retire. It doesn’t matter if your pot comes from a private pension you set up yourself, a workplace pension you paid into, or both.

^You can usually take up to 25% of your [defined contribution pension](/pension-types) pot tax free.^

The remaining 75% you can take as:

## Leave your pension pot untouched

You don’t have to start taking money from your pension pot when you reach your ‘selected retirement age’ (the pension age you agreed with your provider). You can leave the money invested, eg while you’re working. Your provider may charge you administration fees for managing the fund.

As long as your money stays in your pension pot you don’t pay tax on it. You can still pay into it up to your [annual allowance](https://www.gov.uk/tax-on-your-private-pension/annual-allowance).

Your pension pot could grow further and give you a larger amount of money to last for a shorter amount of time. Whatever money you leave in your pension pot you can [pass on](/when-you-die) tax free if you die before the age of 75.

As with every investment the value of your pot could go up or down.

Usually the earliest you can start taking money from your pot is 55. Check with your provider. In some circumstances you can [take your pension earlier](https://www.gov.uk/early-retirement-pension/personal-and-workplace-pensions).

### Your next steps

If you want to leave your pot untouched for a while, ask your pension provider the following questions:

- What are your charges for leaving my money in longer?
- Do I have to take the money by a certain date and are there penalty charges if I don’t?
- How much is the pot likely to grow each year? 
- How is the money invested and can I change this if I want? 
- How much can I still pay in?
- Does my pot have any special arrangements attached to it that could mean I get a better deal, eg a guaranteed value at a certain time?
- Do you have up-to-date details of the person I want to leave my pot to (my ‘beneficiary’)?

## Get a guaranteed income (annuity)

You might want to use your pension pot to buy an insurance policy that gives you a guaranteed income for the rest of your life. This is called an annuity. You can also buy an annuity for a fixed number of years.

^There are lots of different types of annuities and it’s important you get the right one for you.^

Once you’ve bought your annuity you only have a short period when you can still change your mind (in most cases 30 days). After that you can’t change the decision and your rate will be fixed.

From April 2016 you might be able to [sell an annuity you own](/already-bought-annuity) as the government is changing the rules for this. 

###Types of annuities

Types of annuities you can buy:

- single - only you get paid an income either for life or for a fixed number of years
- joint - payments continue to your spouse/partner after you die
- guaranteed period - you fix the number of years where payments to your spouse/partner continue after you die (sometimes this can be a lump sum), the guaranteed period starts the day you take money from your pot, eg you take a guaranteed 10 year annuity and die after 8 years, your spouse/partner gets payments for another 2 years
- escalating - increases every year to reduce the effect of inflation
- enhanced - if your health is bad you may get more money from your annuity

### Tax-free lump sum with annuities

If you decide to buy an annuity you can still take up to 25% of your pension pot tax free as cash. You could then, for example, buy the annuity with the remaining 75%. Under current pension rules you have to buy the annuity within 6 months or alternatively use one of the other options on this page.

### How an annuity is calculated

How much income you get each year from an annuity depends on things like:

- how much you had in your pension pot when you bought the annuity
- your age
- whether you want the income to increase each year
- whether you want the annuity to pay out to someone after you die
- your health and lifestyle

You [pay tax on income from an annuity](/tax), just like you do on your salary.  You may also pay administration charges.

If the insurer you bought your annuity with goes bust you’ll be covered for 90% by the [Financial Services Compensation Scheme](http://www.fscs.org.uk/what-we-cover/).

### Your next steps

If you’re interested in buying an annuity you can:

- [compare annuities](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/annuities) to check how much you might get
- [shop around](/shop-around) for the best deal - you don’t have to stay with your current provider
- make sure you know [how much tax you’ll pay](/tax) on your annuity income
- check with your provider if the annuity they offer is right for you, eg if you’re in poor health you could get a better rate
- ask your provider if your pension pot has any special arrangements attached to it that could mean you get a better deal, eg a guaranteed annuity rate

## Take your money flexibly

There are currently 2 ways you can get a flexible income from your pension pot. The main differences are how you can take the tax-free part and what sort of income you want.

- Option 1: take flexible lump sums of cash - your pot stays where it is and every time you take out cash, 25% of the amount is tax free and 75% is taxable
- Option 2: get a flexible income - you can take 25% of your whole pension pot as a single, tax-free cash sum - the rest is invested to give you a taxable income

%Taking larger sums from your pension pot can mean you pay more tax.%

As with every investment there’s the risk that the value of your fund can go up or down.

### Option 1: Take flexible lump sums of cash

You can take flexible lump sums with any pension pot size. Your pot stays where it is and you can take money out when you want to. 25% of each amount you take out is tax free, the rest is taxable.

Your provider pays you the money with any [tax due](/tax) already taken off. 

$E
**Example**
Your pot is £60,000. You take £6,000 out as cash every year - £1,500 would be tax-free every time, £4,500 would be taxable. If you pay 20% tax you would get £5,100 out of your £6,000. 
$E

You might also have to pay administration charges, including charges every time you withdraw money.

With this option, you’re taking chunks out of your pot and it will eventually run out. Think about how much your take out every year and how long you want your money to last. 

Flexible lump sums are sometimes called ‘uncrystallised fund pension lump sums’ or ‘UFPLS’.

### Option 2: Get a flexible income

With this option you get 25% of your pot as a single, tax-free cash sum. The remainder is then invested to give you a regular income in your retirement, which is taxable.

Most providers don’t offer this option for pots under £30,000. 

You’ll probably need to be involved in choosing and managing your investments. 

The provider you go with will offer you different investment funds with different risks. You pick the funds that are right for you and get a retirement income from your investments. You should think about how much you take out every year and how long you want your money to last.

Alternatively, a financial adviser can create a plan with you for how to invest your money. They can advise you on how much you can take out to make the fund last as long as possible. An adviser will charge you for this. 

Your provider is likely to charge you for running your funds and whenever you get a payment.

If you’re interested in this option you might want to [get financial advice](/shop-around) first.

You can [leave your pot to someone](/when-you-die) when you die but they may have to pay tax on it.

This option is also known as ‘flexi-access drawdown’. 

### Tax with flexible income

The income you get from the fund is taxable. Your provider will pay you the income with any [tax due](/tax) already taken off. 

$E
**Example**
You have a pot of £80,000 and take a tax-free lump sum of £20,000. This leaves you with £60,000 to invest into flexi-access. You get an income of £3,000 a year from your fund. If you pay 20% tax on this your provider pays you £2,400.
$E

If you take the 25% tax-free lump sum, under current pension rules you must buy your flexi-access product within 6 months or use one of the other options on this page.

Alternatively, you can move your pot gradually into flexi-access - you don’t have to move it all at once. Each time you move an amount you can take 25% tax free.

If the pension provider your fund is with goes bust you’ll be covered by the [Financial Services Compensation Scheme](http://www.fscs.org.uk/what-we-cover/).

### Continue to pay in

If you take your money flexibly you could also still pay into the fund if you wanted to, up to a limit of £10,000 a year. This includes your tax relief of 20%. For example, to get a contribution of £10,000 you would only have to pay in £8,000.

### Your next steps

If you’re interested in taking your money flexibly you can:

- check with your current provider if they offer the option and what they charge - if they don’t offer it, you can transfer your pot but you might be charged
- check if your pot has any special arrangements attached to it that could mean you get a better deal, eg a guaranteed value at a certain time
- [get financial advice](/shop-around) if you’re interested in getting a flexible income
- [shop around](/shop-around) - check with providers what products they offer to suit your circumstances
- get some estimates from other providers on how much your pot could grow and what the charges are - usually you just have to fill in a short form on their website. 
- make sure you know [how much tax](/tax) you’ll pay on any money you’re planning to take out

## Cash in your whole pot

If you take your whole pension pot in one go - 25% is tax-free and the remaining [75% is taxable](/tax).

$E
**Example**
Your pot is £60,000.
You can take £15,000 tax-free.
The remaining £45,000 would be taxable.
$E

If you’re considering this option you should think about how you can use the money to give you an income in retirement.

%Taking a large sum of cash from your pension pot can mean you pay more tax.%

### What you can do next

Here are some next steps if you’re interested in cashing in your whole pot:

- check with your provider if you can take 25% tax free
- make sure you know [how much tax you’ll pay](/tax) on the remaining 75%
- if you want to reinvest the money, talk to a [registered financial adviser](http://www.fca.org.uk/register) first

## Mix your pension options
You can mix your options but not all providers offer all the options mentioned here. Mixing your options can be complicated. If you’re interested in this you might want to talk to a financial adviser first to check what’s currently available.

You can mix your options at different times in your retirement. For example, you can take some cash from your pot first and buy an annuity later.

Pension providers are developing new retirement income products all the time, some of which might mix these options.

{: .example--mix }
$E
**Example**

Your pension pot is £60,000. You decide to take 25% as tax-free cash which is £15,000.

{: .example__annuity}
You use £20,000 to buy an annuity. This gives you a taxable income for the rest of your life of about £900 a year.

{: .example__flexible}
You also put £25,000 into a drawdown fund and take out about £5,000 a year for about 5 years.
$E

### Your next steps

If you’re interested in mixing your options:

- look at all options to see which ones are right for you
- shop around - you don’t have to buy a product from your current provider
- [get financial advice](/shop-around#getting-financial-advice) before making a decision
