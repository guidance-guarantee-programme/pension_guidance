# What you can do with your pension pot

You can usually take 25% of your defined contribution pension pot tax free and then choose from a range of options. If you take 25% tax free, you must make a decision on the remaining 75% within 6 months - you can’t then leave it untouched.

You have 6 options:

    <h2>Leave your whole pot untouched</h2>
    <p>You don’t have to start taking money from your pension pot when you reach your ‘selected retirement age’. You can leave your money invested in your pot until you need it.</p>
