# Selling your annuity

Annuity rules will no longer change in 2017 to allow people who already have an annuity to sell it.

Once you’ve bought your annuity you only have a short period when you can still change your mind (in most cases 30 days). After that you can’t change your decision.

The government will be making a full announcement soon.
