# Mixing your pension options

## Overview

You can mix the ways you take your pension pot.

- You can mix the pension options, eg use some of your pot to get an adjustable income and some to buy an annuity.
- Not all providers offer all the options.
- If you have multiple pots, you can use different options for each pot, eg leave one pot untouched and take cash in chunks from another.

**Example**

Your pension pot is £60,000. You decide to take 25% as tax-free cash leaving £45,000.
You use £20,000 to buy an annuity. This gives you a taxable income for the rest of your life of about £900 a year. You use the other £25,000 to get an adjustable income. This allows you to take out about £5,000 a year for 5 years.
