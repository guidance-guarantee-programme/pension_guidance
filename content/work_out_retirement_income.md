# Work out if you’ll have enough money through retirement

To work out if you’ll have enough money to live on through your retirement, you’ll need to:

- find out what you’ll get from your pension pot, the State Pension and any other income you may have
- work out the tax you’ll pay on your retirement income
- look at what your living costs are likely to be
- think about how long your money will need to last 

## Work out your retirement income

You’ll most likely have pensions from your employer, personal pensions you set up yourself and the State Pension paid to you by the government. You might also have other income, eg from work, benefits, rental income, savings, investments, property.

^Taking money from your pension pot can [affect your benefits](/benefits).^

To get an idea of how much you’ll have in retirement, follow these steps:

1. [Check how much is in your pension pot](/pension-pot-value) and which pensions you’ve paid into. 
2. Add your pension pot to your State Pension. Phone the Future Pension Centre on 0345 600 4274 to get a full State Pension statement.
3. Check what other income you’ll have in retirement and how it might change.
4. Choose [what to do with your pot](/pension-pot-options) and [shop around](/shop-around) to get quotes from providers.
5. Take away the [tax you pay](/tax).

## Work out how much you’ll need in retirement

Add up all the living costs you have now. You can use [Money Advice Service’s budget planner](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/budget-planner) to help you work out what they are. 

Take away these costs from your retirement income. This will give you an idea of whether you’ll have enough money through retirement.

Your living costs may change when you retire. For example, you could spend less on travel or your mortgage, but more on energy bills or [care costs](care-costs).

## How long your money needs to last

You need to think about how to make your money last the rest of your life. 

You can use the [Office of National Statistics calculator](http://visual.ons.gov.uk/how-long-will-my-pension-need-to-last/) to estimate your life expectancy. This can help you plan how long your pension may need to last but lifestyle choices and other factors may affect how long you live. 

%Taking too much of your pension money in early retirement could mean you don’t have enough for later.%

## Increase your retirement income

If you don’t think you’ll have enough money to last your retirement you could increase it by:

- paying more into your pot now
- taking your pot later
- delaying when you take the State Pension

###  Pay more into your pot

There’s a limit to how much you can pay into your pot and still get tax relief. You can pay in up to your annual allowance. This is currently £40,000 a year.

Your allowance changes once you start taking money from your pot. 

If you have more than one pot, you can carry on paying into one after you start taking money from another. 

You may still be able to pay into the pot you take money from but you won’t get tax relief on these payments. 

The amount you can pay in drops to a maximum of £10,000 a year once you start taking money from a pot. This includes your [tax relief](https://www.gov.uk/tax-on-your-private-pension/pension-tax-relief) of 20%. For example, to get a contribution of £10,000 you would only have to pay in £8,000.

### Take your pot later

You don’t have to start taking your money at the age your agreed with your provider (known as your ‘selected retirement age). You may be able to [leave your pot untouched](/leave-pot-untouched). Your provider may charge extra fees to do this.

The longer you leave your money invested and continue to pay in, the higher your income could be when you come to take it.

You might want to continue working for a while, possibly part time. Many employers offer [flexible working arrangements](https://www.gov.uk/flexible-working) for people close to or over retirement age.

### State Pension

You can delay when you get the State Pension to help increase your income in retirement. This is called [deferring the State Pension](https://www.gov.uk/deferring-state-pension/what-you-may-get).

You may be able to [top up your State Pension](https://www.gov.uk/statepensiontopup) if you’re:

- a man born before 6 April 1951
- a woman born before 6 April 1953
