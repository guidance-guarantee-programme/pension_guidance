From outside the UK call: +44 20 3733 3495.

Calls cost the same as a normal call - if your calls are free, it’s included.

##Who can book

You should be close to or over 55 and have a [defined contribution pension](pension-types).
This is a pension based on how much you and possibly your employer paid into your pot.
It’s not a final salary pension.


##What you'll get from the appointment

The appointment is a conversation between you and a Pension Wise guidance specialist. You’ll get personal guidance on what you can do with your pension pot.

The guidance specialist will:

* explain your pension options
* explain tax
* discuss which options might be suitable for you
* give you tips on what you can do next

You can:

* ask questions about the options
* discuss what the options mean to you
* discuss how tax might affect you

Afterwards you'll get a letter with a summary of what you talked about.

  <p>Pension Wise guidance specialists are impartial. They don't recommend any products or companies and won’t tell you how to invest your money.</p>

##Make the most of your appointment

Check the value of your pension pot beforehand. Your latest pension statement from your provider will have the amount.

You should also think about when you want to stop working and how much other income you might have in retirement, eg from savings.
