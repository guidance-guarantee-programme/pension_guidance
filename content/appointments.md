# Book a free appointment

An appointment is a 45 minute conversation between you and a Pension Wise guidance specialist. You’ll get personal guidance on what you can do with your pension pot.

Appointments are over the **phone** or **face to face**.

## Before you book

You should be aged **50 or over** and have a **defined contribution** pension. This is a pension based on how much you and possibly your employer paid into your pot. It’s not a final salary pension.

In your appointment, the guidance specialist will:

- explain your pension options
- explain tax
- discuss which options might be suitable for  you
- give you tips on what you can do next

Afterwards you’ll get a letter with a summary of what you talked about.

^ Pension Wise guidance specialists are impartial. They don’t recommend any products or companies and won’t tell you how to invest your money.
