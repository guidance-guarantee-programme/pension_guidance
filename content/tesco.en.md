# About the appointment

An appointment is a conversation between you and a trained Pension Wise guidance specialist. They last around 45 minutes and take place in private at your workplace. Availability is limited to first come, first served.

In your appointment, the guidance specialist will:

- explain your pension options
- explain tax
- discuss which options might be suitable for you
- give you tips on what you can do next

Afterwards you’ll get a summary of what was discussed.

^Pension Wise guidance specialists are impartial. They don’t recommend any products or companies and won’t tell you how to invest your money.^
