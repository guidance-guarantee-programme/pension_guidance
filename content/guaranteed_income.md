# Getting a guaranteed income (annuity)

You can use your pension pot to buy an insurance policy that gives you a guaranteed income for the rest of your life. This is called an annuity. You can also buy an annuity for a fixed number of years.

^There are lots of different types of annuity and it’s important you get the right one for you.^

Once you’ve bought your annuity you only have a short period when you can still change your mind (in most cases 30 days). After that you can’t change the decision and your rate will be fixed.

## Types of annuities

Types of annuities you can buy:

- single - only you get paid an income either for life or for a fixed number of years
- joint - payments continue to your spouse/partner after you die
- guaranteed period - you fix the number of years where payments to your spouse/partner continue after you die (sometimes this can be a lump sum), the guaranteed period starts the day you take money from your pot, eg you take a guaranteed 10 year annuity and die after 8 years, your spouse/partner gets payments for another 2 years
- escalating - increases every year to reduce the effect of inflation
- enhanced - if your health is bad you may get more money from your annuity

## Tax-free lump sum with annuities

If you decide to buy an annuity you can still take up to 25% of your pension pot tax free as cash. You could then, for example, use the other 75% to buy the annuity. Under current pension rules you have to buy the annuity within 6 months or alternatively use one of the [other options](/pension-pot-options).

## How an annuity is calculated

How much income you get each year from an annuity depends on things like:

- how much you had in your pension pot when you bought the annuity
- your age
- whether you want the income to increase each year
- whether you want the annuity to pay out to someone after you die
- your health and lifestyle

You [pay tax on income from an annuity](/tax), just like you do on your salary.  You may also pay administration charges.

If the insurer you bought your annuity with goes bust the [Financial Services Compensation Scheme](http://www.fscs.org.uk/what-we-cover/) will cover you in full.
