## Accessibility statement for Pension Wise

This accessibility statement applies to the domain [pensionwise.gov.uk](https://www.pensionwise.gov.uk).

This website is run by the Money and Pensions Service. We want as many people
as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should
be able to do the following:

* change colours, contrast levels and fonts
* zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
* navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
* navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
* listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)
* access the site on smaller devices

We’ve also made the website text as simple to understand as we can.

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk) has advice on making your device
easier to use if you have a disability.

### Enforcement procedure

The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing

happy with how we respond to your complaint, contact the [Equality Advisory and
Support Service (EASS)](https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com).

## Visiting us in person

Our offices are currently closed because of Covid-19 restrictions. Once we
reopen, you will be welcome to contact us in advance, so that we can arrange
reasonable accommodation for your visit. For example, you will be able to
request a space with low lighting or low noise levels, or you can ask us to
arrange a British Sign Language (BSL) interpreter.

## Technical information about this website’s accessibility

The Money and Pensions Service is committed to making its website accessible,
in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications)
(No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

### Compliance status

This website is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines version 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) AA standard, due to the
non-compliances and exemptions listed below:

## Non-accessible content

### Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations:

* Some forms do not have a label. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1
(Non-text content, Level A) and WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and
Relationships, Level A). We will ensure that all forms have labels by
15/01/2021.
* Some images do not have a text alternative, or the alt text is not equivalent
  to the content of the images, so people using a screen reader cannot access
the information. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (Non-text Content,
Level A). We plan to add text alternatives for all informational images by
15/012021. When we publish new content, we’ll make sure our use of images meets
accessibility standards.
* Some elements are not contained within an appropriate landmark. This fails
  WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships, Level A). We plan
to ensure that all elements are contained within appropriate landmarks by
15/01/2021.
* The site does not always notify screen readers when new content has been
  displayed on the page. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and
Relationships, Level A). We will ensure that all instances of displaying new
content will be communicated to screen readers by 15/01/2021.
* In some places, the order in which the tab key moves through the elements of
  a page does not make sense. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.2
(Meaningful Sequence, Level A). We will revise the tab order by 15/01/2021 so
that the sequence of focus changes using the tab key makes sense.
* Some elements have inadequate colour contrast, so some people may not be able
  to read or understand them. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.3
(Contrast (Minimum), Level AA) and WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.11 (Non-text
contrast, Level AA). We plan to modify the colour contrast of all relevant text
and images/graphics by 22/01/2021, so that all elements of the site will comply
with the WCAG success criteria for colour contrast.
* The site does not fully honour font sizes specified via browser settings or
  assistive technologies. This fails WCAG 2.1 criterion 1.4.4 (Resize text,
Level AA). We will ensure that all user settings and actions that affect text
size will work correctly by 15/01/2021.
* Some links have missing or inadequate hoverstates. When the pointer moves
  over and then away from a selectable element, the change in focus does not
trigger additional content to become visible and then hidden. This fails WCAG
2.1 success criterion 1.4.13 (Content on hover or focus, Level AA). We plan to
update all elements so that they have appropriate hoverstates by 15/01/2021.
* Some parts of the navigation and the content cannot be accessed via the
  keyboard. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.1.1 (Keyboard, Level A). We
will ensure that all parts of the site, including all navigation and all
content, can be accessed via the keyboard by 15/01/2021.
* The mechanism for skipping to the main content is somewhat obscured by our
  logo and is difficult to read. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.1
(Bypass Blocks, Level A). We will ensure that by 15/01/2021 the site provides a
clear way of skipping to the main content.
* Some links are broken and some do not make sense out of context. This fails
  WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.4 (Link Purpose In Context, Level A). We plan
to update the links so that by 15/01/2021 all links work and make sense out of
context.
* Error messages are displayed inconsistently. This fails WCAG 2.1 success
  criterion 3.2.4 (Consistent identification, Level AA). We will ensure that by
15/01/2021 all error messages have the same look.
* The site does not validate all form fields, and some of its error responses
  are inadequate. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 3.3.1 (Error
identification, Level A) and WCAG 2.1 success criterion 3.3.2 (Label or
instructions, Level A). We will ensure that by 15/01/2021 the site validates
all necessary form fields and provides appropriate error responses.
* Some form fields have inadequate labels. This fails WCAG 2.1 success
  criterion 3.3.2 (Label or instructions, Level A). We will ensure that, by
15/01/2021, all form fields have appropriate labels.
* Some elements are missing descriptions or titles. This fails WCAG 2.1 success
  criterion 4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value, Level A). We will ensure that all website
elements have descriptions as specified, by 15/01/2021.

### Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations

Some of our PDFs and Word documents are essential to providing our services.
For example, we have PDFs with information on how users can access our
services, and forms published as Word documents. By March 2021, we plan to
either fix these or replace them with accessible HTML pages in the newly
branded website. 

The accessibility regulations [do not require us to fix PDFs or other documents
published before 23 September
2018](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/4/made) if
they’re not essential to providing our services.

Any new PDF or Word documents we publish will meet accessibility standards.
Before publishing new content as a PDF or Word document, we will make sure that
the alternative format is necessary, [as advised by
GDS](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2018/07/16/why-gov-uk-content-should-be-published-in-html-and-not-pdf/).
