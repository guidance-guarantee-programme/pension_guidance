# Taking your whole pot in one go

You can take your whole pot as cash in one go - 25% is tax-free, the remaining 75% is taxable.

You pay tax when you take money from your pot. This is because when you’re paying into your pension you get [tax relief](https://www.gov.uk/tax-on-your-private-pension/pension-tax-relief) on your contributions.

Any money you receive from your pension provider will be paid to you with the tax already taken off.

## Watch out for higher tax

It’s important to calculate how much tax you would pay if you take your whole pot in one go.

%Taking a large sum of cash from your pot can mean you pay a higher amount of tax.%

The cash you take will be added to any other income you have over the tax year, eg money from work, savings and benefits. At the end of the tax year HM Revenue and Customs will calculate how much tax you owe. 

Adding a large cash sum to your income could mean that you get bumped into a higher tax rate. It could also affect your [entitlement to any benefits](/benefits).

## Your next steps

Here are some next steps if you’re interested in taking your whole pot in one go:

- check with your provider if you can take 25% tax free
- if you want to reinvest the money, talk to a [registered financial adviser](http://www.fca.org.uk/register) first
