        One of the new things you can do with your pension is to cash it all in one go.
      </p>
      <p>
        Normally a quarter of your pot is tax-free but it’s really important to remember that the other three quarters of your pot is subject to tax.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s also important to think about how will you live throughout retirement if you take this option.

You can take your whole pot as cash in one go - 25% is tax-free, the remaining 75% is taxable.

{: .info-notice--take-cash}
$E **Example**
Your pot is £60,000.
You can take £15,000 tax-free.
The remaining £45,000 is taxable.
You don’t have any other income.
**You pay £7,400 in tax on your cash.**
$E

Any cash your provider pays you will have the [tax owed](/tax) already taken off.

## Watch out for higher tax

It’s important to calculate how much tax you would pay on the amount if you take your whole pot in one go.

%Taking a large sum of cash from your pension pot can mean you pay a higher amount of tax.%

The cash you take will be added to any other income you have over the tax year.  At the end of the tax year HM Revenue and Customs will calculate how much tax you owe.

Adding a large cash sum to your income could mean that you get bumped into a higher tax rate.

**Example**
Your current income for the year is £20,000 and you pay tax at the basic rate of 20%.
Your pension pot is £60,000.
You get £15,000 tax free.
The remaining £45,000 is added to your other income of £20,000.
Your total income for the year is now £65,000.
Everything over £31,785 will be taxed at the higher rate of 40%.
**You’ll pay £15,400 in tax.**
$E

Adding a large sum of cash to your income could also affect [your entitlement to any benefits](/benefits).

## Your next steps

Here are some next steps if you’re interested in taking cash:

- check with your provider if you can take 25% tax free
- make sure you know [how much tax you’ll pay](/tax) on the remaining 75%
- if you want to reinvest the money, talk to a [registered financial adviser](http://www.fca.org.uk/register) first
