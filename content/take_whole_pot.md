# Taking your whole pot in one go

You can take your whole pot as cash in one go - 25% is tax-free, the other 75% is taxable.

You pay tax when you take money from your pot. This is because when you’re paying into your pension you get [tax relief](https://www.gov.uk/tax-on-your-private-pension/pension-tax-relief) on your contributions.

Any money you receive from your pension provider will be paid to you with the tax already taken off.

## Watch out for higher tax

It’s important to calculate how much tax you would pay if you take your whole pot in one go.

%Taking a large sum of cash from your pot can mean you pay a higher amount of tax.%

Taking a large amount of cash from your pot at once could mean that you get bumped into a higher tax rate. This is because it’s added to any other income you have for that year, eg money from work. 

At the end of the tax year HM Revenue and Customs will calculate how much tax you owe. It could also affect your [entitlement to any benefits](/benefits).

## Watch out for scams

Beware of [pension scams](/scams) contacting you unexpectedly about an investment or business opportunity that you’ve not spoken to them about before. You could lose all your money and face tax of up to 55% and extra fees.

## Your next steps

Here are some next steps if you’re interested in taking your whole pot in one go:

- check with your provider if they offer this option – they may charge you a fee if you move your pension to a provider that does
- you can take 25% tax free
- if you want to reinvest the money, talk to a [registered financial adviser](http://www.fca.org.uk/register) first
