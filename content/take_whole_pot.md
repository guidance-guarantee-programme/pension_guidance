# Taking your whole pot in one go

You can take your whole pot as cash in one go - 25% is tax-free, the remaining 75% is taxable.

Any cash your provider pays you will have the [tax owed](/tax) already taken off.

## Watch out for higher tax

It’s important to calculate how much tax you would pay on the amount if you take your whole pot in one go.

%Taking a large sum of cash from your pension pot can mean you pay a higher amount of tax.%

The cash you take will be added to any other income you have over the tax year.  At the end of the tax year HM Revenue and Customs will calculate how much tax you owe.

Adding a large cash sum to your income could mean that you get bumped into a higher tax rate.

Adding a large sum of cash to your income could also affect [your entitlement to any benefits](/benefits).

## Your next steps

Here are some next steps if you’re interested in taking cash:

- check with your provider if you can take 25% tax free
- if you want to reinvest the money, talk to a [registered financial adviser](http://www.fca.org.uk/register) first
