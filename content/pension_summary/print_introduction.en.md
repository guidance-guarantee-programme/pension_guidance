# Getting started

This is a summary of the defined contribution pension options you selected to read about. This is your personal or workplace pension and is based on how much has been paid into your pot.

This is not a final salary or career average pension.

You may have more than one defined contribution pension pot. You can choose different options for each pot.

If you want to talk about your options for taking your money you can book a free Pension Wise appointment.

An appointment is a conversation with a pension specialist. You can speak to us over the phone or face to face somewhere local to you.

Go to [moneyhelper.org.uk/pensionwise](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/pensionwise) to book online or call 0800 280 8880 (+44 20 3733 3495 if youâ€™re outside the UK).
