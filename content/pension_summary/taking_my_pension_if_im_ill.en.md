# Pensions and ill health

## If you’re ill

You may be able to take your pension pot early if you can’t work because you’re too ill.

This could be before you’re 55 or your ‘selected retirement age’ – the age you agreed with your provider to retire. Speak to your provider about the rules of your pension.

An ‘enhanced’ or ‘impaired’ annuity may pay more than a standard annuity if you smoke or have a medical condition, e.g. diabetes or high blood pressure.

## If you have a serious illness

Special tax rules apply if you have a serious illness which means you’re expected to live for less than a year.

You may be able to take your whole pension pot tax free if **all** of the following apply to you:

* you’re expected to live for less than a year because of serious illness
* you’re under 75 (if you’re over 75 you pay Income Tax on the lump sum)
* you don’t have more than the lifetime allowance in pension money, £1,073,100.

Check the terms of your pension with your provider. Some pensions will keep at least 50% of your pot for your spouse or partner.

## Next steps

### Things to consider

* Think about whether you want a cash sum now or a type of income
* Think about how you want to leave money behind
* Think about the most tax-efficient way of leaving your money – you can speak to a financial adviser to help with this

### Questions to ask your provider

1. What are the rules on taking my money if I’m seriously ill?
2. Do you have up-to-date details of who I want to leave money to (my ‘beneficiary’)?
