# Mix your options

You can mix your options, e.g. use some of your pot to get a flexible retirement income and some to buy a guaranteed retirement income.

## Key facts

* Not all providers offer all the options.
* If you have more than one pot, you can use different options for each pot, e.g. delay taking one and take a number of lumps sums from another.

## Next steps

If you’re interested in this option, you’ll need to contact your provider and ask the following questions.

### Questions to ask your provider

1. Which pensions do you offer?
2. Can I mix some options together?
3. Will you charge me a fee if I move my pot to a provider that offers the option I want?
