# Debt and pensions

You should think carefully about taking money from your pension pot to pay off debts. Money you take from your pot now could leave you with less to live on in the future.

If you have an arrangement to pay your debts, creditors may be able to access some or all of the pension income or lump sums you take.

This includes money or income from:

* a guaranteed income (annuity)
* an adjustable income
* cash in chunks
* taking your whole pot in one go

Find out the status of any debt arrangement you have before choosing a pension option.
