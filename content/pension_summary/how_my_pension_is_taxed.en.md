# Tax you pay on your pension

You pay Income Tax on 75% of your pension pot. How much you pay depends on your total income for the year and your tax rate.

## Other tax you could pay

You could also pay Income Tax on:

- your State Pension
- earnings from employment or self-employment
- any other income, e.g. money from rental income, savings, investments
- any taxable benefits you might get, e.g. Carer’s Allowance

## The 25% tax-free amount

Your tax-free amount doesn’t use up any of your Personal Allowance – the amount of income you don’t have to pay tax on. The standard Personal Allowance is £12,570.

There are 2 ways you can take your tax-free amount.

### Take it all in one go

You can take 25% as a lump sum without paying tax. If you do this, you can’t leave the remaining 75% untouched. You must either:

- buy a guaranteed income (annuity)
- get a flexible retirement income (pension drawdown)
- take the whole pot as cash

^**Example**<br/><br/>Your pot is £60,000 and you take £15,000 – this is your tax-free lump sum. You buy an annuity with the remaining £45,000 which pays you £2,000 a year. This money is taxable.^

### Take it in chunks

You can take smaller cash sums from your pension pot without paying tax. 25% of each chunk is tax free.

^**Example**<br /><br />Your pot is £60,000 and you take out £10,000. £2,500 of this is tax free and £7,500 is taxable.^

## How your tax is paid

Money you take from your pot comes from your provider with the tax already taken off.

Your provider will also take off any tax due on your State Pension.

You may pay emergency tax when you take money from your pot. You can [claim this back](https://www.gov.uk/claim-tax-refund/you-get-a-pension){: target="_blank" rel="external"} from HM Revenue and Customs.

### If you continue to work

Your employer will take any tax you owe off your earnings and your State Pension. This is called Pay As You Earn (PAYE).

If your total income (including money from pensions and PAYE) is £100,000 or more for the tax year, or if you’re self-employed, you’ll have to fill in a Self-Assessment tax return.

### If you have other income

You’re responsible for paying tax on other income you have, e.g. from property or investments, and you might have to fill in a Self-Assessment tax return.

  <p>You usually pay tax if your pension pots are worth more than the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-on-your-private-pension/lifetime-allowance" target="_blank" rel="external">lifetime allowance</a>. This was £1,073,100 before 6 April 2023. You won't be subject to the lifetime allowance if you take your pension after this, but may be subject to the new lump sum allowance (LSA) or lump sum and death benefit allowance (LSDBA).</p>
