# Get a flexible retirement income (pension drawdown)

You can normally take up to 25% of your pot tax free. The rest is invested to give you a taxable income. You decide how much you take out each year and how long you want your money to last. The value of your pot can go up or down depending on your investment choices. Pension providers may describe this option as pension drawdown.

* You get an income from your pot which is taxable. You decide how much to take out and when, and how long you want it to last.

## Key facts

* You get an income from your pot which is taxable. You decide how much to take out and when, and how long you want it to last.
* You can take up to 25% of your pot tax free – if you do this, you must move the remaining 75% into a flexible income product or use one of the other options.
* Your provider will ask you how you want to invest your remaining pot when you move into pension drawdown. You will either need to choose your own investments, i.e. ones that match your attitude to risk and objectives for your money, or some providers will offer you to choose from simple ready-made investment options which are linked to your retirement plans (these are called Investment Pathways). You could also use a financial adviser to help you choose.
* An investment pathway is a ready-made investment option, which simplifies the decision of how to invest your remaining pension pot after you’ve taken your tax-free lump sum.
* As with all investments, the value of your pot can go up or down.
* You may be able to keep paying in after you take money out but you could pay tax on contributions over £10,000 a year (known as the [‘money purchase annual allowance’ (MPAA)](https://www.gov.uk/tax-on-your-private-pension/annual-allowance#lower-allowance-if-you-take-money-from-a-pension-pot){: target="_blank" rel="external"}).

^You can’t take the pension as a number of lump sums option later if you choose this option because you will have already taken your full tax-free lump sum.^
