# Get an adjustable income

You can get an income from your pension pot that’s adjustable. This means you get a regular income but can change the amount you get or take cash sums if you need to.

## Key facts

* You get an income from your pot which is taxable. You decide how much to take out and when, and how long you want it to last.
* You can take up to 25% of your pot tax free – if you do this, you must move the remaining 75% into an adjustable income product or use one of the other options.
* You’re likely to be involved in choosing and managing your investments.
* As with all investments, the value of your pot can go up or down.
* This option is also known as ‘flexi-access drawdown’.
* You may be able to keep paying in after you take money out but you could pay tax on contributions over £4,000 a year (known as the [‘money purchase annual allowance’ (MPAA)](https://www.gov.uk/tax-on-your-private-pension/annual-allowance#lower-allowance-if-you-take-money-from-a-pension-pot){: target="_parent"}).

^You can’t take the cash in chunks option later if you choose this option because you will have already taken your full tax-free lump sum.^

## Next steps
