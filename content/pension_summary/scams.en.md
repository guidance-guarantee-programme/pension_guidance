# Pension scams

A pension scam is where someone tries to con you out of money in your pension pot. A scam will often start with a ‘cold call’ – this can be a phone call, a text message, an email, a visit in person, or other ways.

^If someone calls you out of the blue about your pension, the call is illegal and likely to be a fraudster. You should end the call immediately and alert the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/nuisance-calls-and-messages/" target="_blank">Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)</a>.^

## How to spot a scam

It’s likely to be a scam if an individual or company:

* says they can help you access your pension money before 55
* encourages you to take out a large lump sum or your whole pot in one go and to let them invest it for you
* asks you to transfer your money quickly, even sending documents to you by courier – you should never rush a decision about your pension money
* uses words like ‘pension liberation’, ‘loan’, ‘loophole’ or ‘free pension review’
* offers you an investment described as ‘unique’, ‘overseas’, ‘environmentally friendly’, ‘ethical’ or in a ‘new’ industry

Always phone your provider if you receive an email saying that they’ve changed their bank details and want you to make payments into a new account – this is almost always a scam.

%Once you’ve transferred your pension money into a scam, it’s too late. You could lose all your money and face a tax bill of up to 55% of the amount transferred. Your provider may also charge you fees.%
