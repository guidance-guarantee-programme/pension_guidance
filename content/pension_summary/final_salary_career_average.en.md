# Final salary or career average pensions

These pensions (known as ‘defined benefit’) give you an income based on your
salary and length of service with an employer. The 6 pension options only apply
to personal or workplace pensions (known as ‘defined contribution’).

To choose one of the 6 options, you would need to transfer your defined benefit
pension to a defined contribution one. The value of your defined benefit
pension gets transferred as cash and is invested into a defined contribution
pot. This then gives you access to the same options as people with defined
contribution pensions.

## Things to consider

* A defined benefit pension gives you a guaranteed income. A transfer to a defined contribution pot will mean giving up valuable pension scheme benefits.
* Some employers don’t accept transfers – check first.
* Sometimes employers offer incentives to transfer, eg cash payments – you should think carefully about accepting these.
* Look out for pension scams. If an individual or company contacts you and promises great returns from a defined contribution pot or says it’s a great opportunity to free up cash, it’s probably a scam.
* Speak to a financial adviser before you transfer. If you have a defined benefit pension worth more than £30,000 (known as your ‘safeguarded benefits’) you legally have to get financial advice first.
