# Take your whole pot in one go

You can take your whole pension pot as cash. The money from your pot will be added to any other income you have over the tax year.

## Key facts

* If you take your whole pension pot in one go 25% is tax free and the remaining 75% is taxable.
* Adding a large cash sum to your income could put you in a higher tax band.
* You can take up to 3 small pots of up to £10,000 without it counting towards your annual or lifetime tax allowance.
* Taking your whole pot in one go could affect your entitlement to benefits.
* You may be able to keep paying in after you take money out but you could pay tax on contributions over £4,000 a year (known as the [‘money purchase annual allowance’ (MPAA)](https://www.gov.uk/tax-on-your-private-pension/annual-allowance#lower-allowance-if-you-take-money-from-a-pension-pot)).

You should think about this option. Once you’ve taken the money out you can’t change the decision and you lose the tax-free status it had while in your pot.  

^You need to be aware of ‘pension recycling’ tax laws if you plan to cash in one pot and pay into another.^
