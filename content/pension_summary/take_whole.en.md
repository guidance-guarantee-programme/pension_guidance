# Take your whole pension in one go

You can take your whole pension pot as cash. Think carefully before choosing this option, as you'll get taxed on most of it.

## Key facts

* If you take your whole pension pot in one go 25% is tax free and the remaining 75% is taxable.
* Adding a large cash sum to your income could put you in a higher tax band.
* You can take up to 3 small pots of up to £10,000 without it counting towards your annual or tax allowances.
* Taking your whole pot in one go could affect your entitlement to benefits.
* You may be able to keep paying in after you take money out but you could pay tax on contributions over £10,000 a year (known as the [‘money purchase annual allowance’ (MPAA)](https://www.gov.uk/tax-on-your-private-pension/annual-allowance#lower-allowance-if-you-take-money-from-a-pension-pot){: target="_blank" rel="external"}).

You should think about this option. Once you’ve taken the money out you can’t change the decision and you lose the tax-free status it had while in your pot.
