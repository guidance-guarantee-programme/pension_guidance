# Retire later or delay taking your pension pot

You can leave your money invested in your pot until you need it. Your pot could grow further and give you a larger amount of money to last for a shorter amount of time. You (and your employer) can still pay into your pot but there may be restrictions.

You can’t usually access your pension pot until age 55, this is increasing to age 57 on 6 April 2028.

This is important for those born after 6 April 1971, as it could mean that you are unable to access your pension until 2 years later than you expected.

The rules are complicated so you should check with your pension provider.

## Key facts

* While the money stays in your pot you don’t pay tax on it.
* It’s up to you when you take the money out – the earliest is usually aged 55, unless you have a serious illness.
* If someone contacts you unexpectedly about getting money out of your pot before you’re 55, it’s nearly always a pension scam.
* Money left untouched can be passed on when you die.

## Next steps

If you’re interested in this option, you’ll need to contact your provider and ask the following questions.

### Questions to ask your provider
1. Do I have to take the money by a certain date?
2. What are the fees for continuing to leave my pot untouched?
3. How is the money invested and can I change this if I want?
4. How much can I still pay in?
5. Does my pot have any special features like a guaranteed annuity rate?
6. Do you have up-to-date details of who I want to leave my pot to (my ‘beneficiary’) when I die?
