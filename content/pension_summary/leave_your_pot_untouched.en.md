# Leave your pot untouched

You can leave your money invested in your pot until you need it. Your pot could grow further and give you a larger amount of money to last for a shorter amount of time. You (and your employer) can still pay into your pot but there may be restrictions.

## Key facts

* While the money stays in your pot you don’t pay tax on it.
* It’s up to you when you take the money out – the earliest is usually aged 55, unless you have a serious illness.
* If someone contacts you unexpectedly about getting money out of your pot before you’re 55, it’s nearly always a pension scam.
* Money left untouched can be passed on when you die.

5. How much can I still pay in?
6. Does my pot have any special features like a guaranteed annuity rate?
7. Do you have up-to-date details of who I want to leave my pot to (my ‘beneficiary’) when I die?
