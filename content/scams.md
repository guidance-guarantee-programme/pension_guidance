#How to avoid a pension scam

Pension scams, in which criminals cheat people out of their pension pots, are increasing.

There are different types of scam. They often begin by someone giving you a ‘cold call’ - contacting you unexpectedly about:

- an investment or other business opportunity that you’ve not previously spoken to them about
- taking your pension money before you’re 55
- the ways that you can invest your pension money

A cold call doesn’t have to be a telephone call. It can be any type of contact they’ve made with you unexpectedly, eg an email.

^You can only [take your pension money before you’re 55](https://www.gov.uk/early-retirement-pension/personal-and-workplace-pensions) in rare cases, eg if you’re very ill.^

Scammers may offer you tempting ways to invest your pension pot, eg investing it in a new hotel being built in an exotic location.

Most of these offers are fake but can appear very convincing. Their aim is to get you to cash in your pension pot and transfer the money. **Once you’ve transferred your money into a scam, it’s too late.** You could lose all your pension money as well as face [tax of up to 55%](https://www.gov.uk/tax-on-pension/higher-tax-on-unauthorised-payments) or huge additional fees.


##How to tell if it’s a scam

Watch out if an individual or company:

* cold calls you about your pension money through a phone call, a text message, visiting you in person, or in other ways
* says you can access your pension money before 55 and that they can help you with this
* encourages you to take out a large lump sum, or your whole pension pot as cash, and to let them invest it for you
* asks you to transfer your money quickly, even sending documents to you by courier - never make a rush decision about your pension money
* uses words like ‘pension liberation’, ‘loan’, ‘loophole’, ‘free pension review’ or ‘one-off investment’
* offers you an investment described as ‘unique’, ‘overseas’, ‘environmentally friendly’, ‘ethical’ or in a ‘new’ industry

##How to protect yourself


Check if the person or company contacting you is on the [Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Register](http://www.fca.org.uk/register) or by calling the FCA on 0800 111 6768. If you call the person or company back, use the phone number for them that’s on the FCA Register.

You may be approached by someone claiming to be a pension provider, a financial adviser or from the government. Remember that the government won’t:

* encourage you to take your pension money before you’re 55
* approach you with recommendations about how to invest or spend your pension money
* cold call you for specific information about your pension or finances, eg how much is in your pension pot, who your pension provider is or what your bank details are

%If anyone cold calls you claiming to be from the government and asks for your personal or financial details, don’t reveal them. Hang up if you need to.%
