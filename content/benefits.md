#Benefits

The money you take from your pension pot could affect your eligibility for some benefits.

##Pensions and benefits entitlement

Any money in or taken from your pension pot may affect your entitlement to some benefits. This can, for example, be money in a flexi-access drawdown fund, income you get from an annuity, or a tax-free lump sum you take.

This money could mean you’re not eligible for a certain benefit.


##When your pension affects your benefits

How money from your pension is assessed depends on whether you or your partner have reached the qualifying age for Pension Credit - use the [State Pension calculator](https://www.gov.uk/calculate-state-pension/y/age) to check when this is.

The following money from your or your partner’s pension pot may affect your entitlement to benefits:

- before Pension Credit qualifying age: any income or cash sums you’ve taken from your pot
- after Pension Credit qualifying age: any money sitting in your pot, plus any income or cash taken

Cash includes taking your pot in chunks or in one go.

**Example** You’re 67 and applying for Housing Benefit. You’ve taken £10,000 tax-free cash from your pot. Your remaining pot is £30,000. Because you’re past Pension Credit qualifying age both amounts will count when your benefit is assessed.

##Taking an income from your pension

Once you reach Pension Credit qualifying age you may or may not take an income from your pension. These are the rules how your benefit will be assessed.

If you don’t take an income:

- the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) or your local council will check how much you’d receive if you bought an annuity
- this amount will be taken into account when your income is assessed - this is known as your ‘notional income’

If you do take an income:

 - if it’s lower than your notional income, the higher amount will be taken into account when your income is assessed
 - if it’s higher than your notional income, this amount will be used instead

**Example** You’re 69 and applying for Council Tax Reduction. You have a pension pot of £40,000 and take an adjustable income of £1,000 a year from it. Your local council have calculated that you could get £1,800 a year from an annuity. They will take £1,800 into account when assessing your income.

It’s your responsibility to tell DWP or your local council if you or your partner take any money from your pension pot.

%If you deliberately spend or give away money (including tax-free cash) from your pension pot to get or increase benefits and help with care costs, DWP or your local council may assess your eligibility again and treat you as still having that money.%

In addition to any income or cash taken from your pension pot, your other assets (eg savings and investments) may also count when you’re assessed for benefits.
