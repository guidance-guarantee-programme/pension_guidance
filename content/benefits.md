# Benefits

Any pension money you have may affect your entitlement to benefits. This applies if you take money out of your pension pot, leave it in or sell an annuity.

##Before Pension Credit qualifying age

Before you or your partner reach the [qualifying age for Pension Credit](https://www.gov.uk/calculate-state-pension/y/age) any money you **take out of** your pot will be taken into account when you’re assessed for benefits. 

This might, for example, be income you get from an annuity, a tax-free lump sum, or an adjustable income. 

##After Pension Credit qualifying age

After you or your partner reach Pension Credit qualifying age any money you **take out of** or **leave in** your pot will be taken into account when your income is assessed. 

$E
**Example** You’re 67 and applying for Housing Benefit. You have a pension pot of £40,000 and have taken £10,000 tax-free cash from your pot. Your remaining pot is £30,000. Because you’re past Pension Credit qualifying age both amounts will count when you're assessed for benefits.

###Leaving your pot untouched 

If you leave money in a pension pot the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) or your local council will check how much you’d get if you had bought an annuity.

They’ll take this amount into account when they assess your income.

###Adjustable income

If you take an adjustable income they’ll look at how much you’d get if you bought an annuity, and how much adjustable income you’re taking. The higher amount will be used when you’re assessed for benefits.

$E
**Example** You’re 69 and applying for Council Tax Reduction. You have a pension pot of £40,000 and take an adjustable income of £1,000 a year from it. Your local council have calculated that you could get £1,800 a year from an annuity – they'll use this figure when you're assessed for benefits.

It’s your responsibility to tell DWP, HMRC or your local council if you or your partner take any money from your pension pot.

%If you deliberately spend or give away money (including tax-free cash) from your pension pot to get or increase benefits, DWP or your local council may assess your eligibility again and treat you as still having that money.%

As well as any income or cash taken from your pension pot, your other assets (eg savings and investments) may also count when you’re assessed for benefits.

##Selling an annuity
If you already have an annuity and sell it to get a cash lump sum, it will be treated as any other income and taken into account when your benefits are calculated.

You must tell DWP, HMRC or your local council if you sell your annuity.

%If you deliberately spend or give away money from selling your annuity to get or increase benefits, DWP or your local council may re-assess your eligibility.%
