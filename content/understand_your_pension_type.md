# Understand your pension type

## Overview
A pension is a way to save money to give you an income later in your life.

You can get a pension from personal or workplace schemes you pay into and the government.
The money you receive from your pension is known as retirement income.

You can begin to take money from your pension when you retire and [you have to choose how you take it](/your-options/overview).
This is the stage at which you have to make a decision about how you want to receive your retirement income.

You don’t have to retire to take money from your pension. You can normally do this from the age of 55.

## The State Pension
The pension you get from the government is called the State Pension. You get it when you reach [State Pension age](https://www.gov.uk/calculate-state-pension).

The most you can currently get from the basic State Pension is £113.10 per week. You don’t normally get it automatically - 
you have to [claim the State Pension](https://www.gov.uk/state-pension/how-to-claim).

If you reach State Pension age on or after 6 April 2016 you’ll get the [new State Pension](https://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension).

## Pension types
Along with the State Pension, there are 2 other main types of pension:

- a pension based on how much has been paid into your pot (known as defined contribution)
- a pension based on your salary near retirement (known as defined benefit)

## How much you get
For most pensions based on how much has been paid into your pot, what you get depends on:

- the amount you’ve paid in
- the length of time the money’s invested
- how well the pension fund’s investments have done

For pensions based on your salary near retirement, how much you get depends on:

- the number of years you’ve worked for the employer
- your salary (this could be your final salary or your average salary across your career with the employer)
- a formula used by your employer to calculate your retirement income

## Shopping around
Whatever you decide to do with your pension pot, you don’t have to stay with the same provider.

For example, you don’t have to buy an annuity from your current pension provider. There are different kinds of annuity 
and you can [shop around to get the best deal](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-to-shop-around-for-an-annuity).

### Comparing annuities
To compare annuities, you generally need to have the following information ready:

- the value of your pension pot
- the age you plan to retire
- your postcode
- the type of annuity you want (eg, one that will continue to pay your partner after your death)

You can choose to shop around on your own or get the help of an independent financial adviser (IFA).

### Comparing income drawdown products
To compare income drawdown products, you need to understand how well an investment fund is doing and be able to look 
out for fees. You might want to get [help from an IFA](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/choosing-a-financial-adviser) 
with this.

*[annuity]: Gives you a regular income in your retirement, usually for the rest of your life.
