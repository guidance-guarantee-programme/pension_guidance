# You might have a defined benefit pension

Pension Wise only gives guidance on defined contribution pensions.

For guidance on the State Pension and defined benefit pensions go to [The Pensions Advisory Service](http://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk).

^If you have more than one pension, you may also have a defined contribution pension â€“ [check another pension](/pension-types).^
