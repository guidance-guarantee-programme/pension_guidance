# Getting an adjustable income

You can get an income from your pension pot that’s adjustable. This means you get a regular income but can change it  or take cash sums if you need to.

You get 25% of your pot as a single, tax-free cash sum. The rest is then invested to give you a regular income in your retirement, which is taxable.

You’ll probably need to be involved in choosing and managing your investments.

**Example**
You have a pension pot of £40,000. You take 25% tax free which is £10,000. You invest the other £30,000 in a fund to give you an adjustable income. Your fund grows by 3% every year.  You take an income of £2,000 from it. Your fund will last you 20 years.

Not all pension providers offer this option. If your provider doesn’t offer it, you can transfer your pot to another provider but you might have to pay a fee.

## How adjustable income works
The provider you choose will offer you different investment funds with different risks. You pick the funds that are right for you and get a retirement income from your investments. You should think about how much you want to take out every year and how long you want your money to last.

You may choose to get financial advice first. A financial adviser can help you create an investment plan for your money. They can advise you on how much you can take out to make the fund last as long as possible. An adviser will charge you for this.

Your provider is likely to charge you fees for running your funds and whenever you get a payment.

This option is also known as ‘flexi-access drawdown’.

## Tax with adjustable income
The income you get from the fund is taxable. Your provider will pay you the income with any [tax due](/tax) already taken off.

**Example**
You have a pot of £80,000 and take a tax-free lump sum of £20,000. This leaves you with £60,000 to invest. You get an income of £3,000 a year from your fund. If you pay 20% tax on this your provider pays you £2,400.

If you take the 25% tax-free lump sum, under current pension rules you must move the rest into flexi-access drawdown within 6 months or use one of the [other options](/pension-pot-options).

You can also move your pot gradually - you don’t have to move it all at once. Each time you move an amount you can take 25% tax free.

If the pension provider your fund is with goes bust you’ll be covered by the [Financial Services Compensation Scheme](http://www.fscs.org.uk/what-we-cover).


## Continue to pay in
You could still pay into other pots up to a limit of £40,000 a year. This includes tax relief of 20%.

Once you start taking an income from your flexi-access fund this allowance goes down to £10,000 a year. It still includes your tax relief. For example, to get a contribution of £10,000 you would only have to pay in £8,000.

You can also pay into your flexi-access fund but you won’t get tax relief on these payments.

## Getting financial advice for adjustable income
If you’re interested in this option you might want to [get financial advice](/shop-around) first. You should be aware that as with every investment there’s the risk that the value of your fund can go up or down.

You can [leave your pot to someone](/when-you-die) when you die but they may have to pay tax on it.
