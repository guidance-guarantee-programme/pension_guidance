You don’t have to start taking money from your pension pot when you reach your ‘selected retirement age’ (the pension age you agreed with your provider).

You can leave the money invested, eg while you’re working. Your pension pot could grow further and give you a larger amount of money to last for a shorter amount of time.

## Tax when you leave your whole pot untouched

As long as your money stays in your pension pot you don’t pay tax on it. You can still pay into it up to your [annual allowance](https://www.gov.uk/tax-on-your-private-pension/annual-allowance).

Whatever money you leave in your pension pot you can [pass on](/when-you-die) tax free if you die before the age of 75.

## Charges and investment risk
Your provider may charge you administration fees for managing the fund.

As with every investment the value of your pot could go up or down.

Usually the earliest you can start taking money from your pot is 55. Check with your provider. In some circumstances you can [take your pension earlier](https://www.gov.uk/early-retirement-pension/personal-and-workplace-pensions).

## Your next steps

If you want to leave your pot untouched for a while, ask your pension provider the following questions:

- What are your charges for leaving my money in longer?
- Do I have to take the money by a certain date and are there penalty charges if I don’t?
- How much is the pot likely to grow each year?
- How is the money invested and can I change this if I want?
- How much can I still pay in?
- Does my pot have any special features that could mean I get a better deal, eg a guaranteed annuity rate?
- Do you have up-to-date details of the person I want to leave my pot to (my ‘beneficiary’)?
