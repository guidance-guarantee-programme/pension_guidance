# Understand your pension statement

A pension statement is an update on your pension from your provider. It shows the current value of your pension pot and 
what you might get back when you decide to start taking money from it.

Your pension statement should tell you your pension type, eg defined contribution or final salary or career average 
(defined benefit). It may also show if your pension has any special features.

You normally get one pension statement a year. Your provider may call this your annual or yearly statement.

Your pension statement may refer to a ‘scheme’, ‘plan’ or ‘policy’. 

If it shows a value, eg a ‘total plan value’ or ‘fund value’, it’s likely your pension type is [defined contribution](/pension-types). 
This means you can [book a Pension Wise appointment](/appointments).

If your statement shows a pension value at retirement linked to your salary and length of service with an employer, 
your pension type is likely to be final salary or career average (defined benefit).

### Transfer Value
Your statement will also normally show the ‘transfer value’ of your pot. 
This is the amount you would get if you switched provider or cashed in your whole pot.

## Special features

Your pension may have special arrangements or features attached to it, eg a guaranteed annuity rate, market value 
reduction or early retirement penalty.

%Special features aren’t always listed in pension statements. Call your provider and ask if your pension has any special arrangements or features.%

### Guaranteed annuity rate

Look for ‘guaranteed annuity rate’ in your statement. This is not the guaranteed period (the minimum length of time your annuity will be paid for if you were to die early).

A guaranteed annuity rate means your pension will pay a fixed rate of income. This would have been set when you started your pension. 

Many pensions sold before 1990 offered these rates. They may offer better value than annuities available elsewhere.

### Market value reduction

If your statement shows your pension is invested in a ‘with-profits’ fund, it could mean it has a market value reduction.

This means your pot value is reduced in certain circumstances, eg if investments perform poorly.

### Early retirement penalty

Look at the transfer value to see if your pension has an early retirement penalty. If it’s lower than the total pot value, 
it’s likely your provider will charge you for taking your money early. If the transfer value is the same as your pot value, 
you don’t have a penalty.

You can also check your ‘wake-up’ pack - you get this from your pension provider between 4 and 6 months before your
agreed pension age. This pack may contain information on any special arrangements attached to your pension.

You can also check your original pension documents from when you started the pension.
