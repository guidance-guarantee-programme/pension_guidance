# Taking cash in chunks

You can take smaller sums of cash from your pot until it runs out. How much you take and when you take it is up to you.

With this option the 25% tax free isn’t paid as one lump sum. Instead, it's applied each time you take cash out. So with each chunk of cash you take from your pot, 25% of it is tax free and the other 75% is taxable.

Your pension provider will take off the [tax you owe](/tax) before they pay you the cash.

Some providers will charge you a fee to take cash out.

**Example**
Your pot is £60,000.
You take out £10,000 each year.
£2,500 is tax free.
£7,500 is taxable.
You don’t have any other income and this is below the Personal Allowance of £10,600.
**You don’t pay tax on your cash.**

Any cash your provider pays you will have the [tax owed](/tax) already taken off. Some providers also charge you a fee to take cash out.

Taking a large sum of cash from your pension pot could also affect [your entitlement to any benefits](/benefits).

Pension providers may describe this option as ‘Uncrystallised Funds Pension Lump Sum’ (UFPLS). Not all providers offer this option. If your provider doesn’t offer it, you can transfer your pot but you might have to pay a fee.

## Watch out for scams

Beware of [pension scams](/scams) contacting you unexpectedly about an investment or business opportunity that you’ve not spoken to them about before. You could lose all your money and face tax of up to 55% and extra fees.

## Watch out for higher tax

It’s important to calculate how much tax you might pay if you want to take your pension pot as cash in chunks.

Taking a large amount of cash at once could mean that you get bumped into a higher tax rate as it’s added to any other income you have for that year.

If you spread the cash amounts over more than one tax year, you might pay less tax on them.

## Continuing to pay in

If you have multiple pension pots, you can take chunks of cash from one and continue to pay into others. The maximum you can pay in is £10,000 a year. This includes your tax relief of 20%. For example, to get a contribution of £10,000 you would only have to pay in £8,000.

Your provider may also let you continue to pay into the pot you take cash from.

## Your next steps

Here are some next steps if you’re interested in taking cash in chunks:

- ask your current provider if they offer the option and what they charge in fees - if they don’t offer it, you can transfer your pot but you might be charged a fee
- check if your pot has any special features that could mean you get a better deal, eg a guaranteed annuity rate
- make sure you know [how much tax](/tax) you’ll pay on any money you’re planning to take out
