# Can I sell my annuity?

You may be able to sell your annuity if it was set up by yourself, eg the policy is in your name. 

For example, if you had a defined contribution pension which was arranged by you and used to buy the annuity, you may be able to sell it.

This includes single and joint-life annuities and annuities bought in the future.


## When you can’t sell

You won’t be able to sell your annuity if you had a [defined benefit](/pension-types) pension.

You won’t be able to sell your annuity if it’s in the name of the company you worked for or bought the annuity from.

You may be able to re-assign the annuity to your name. Speak to your provider to find out if you can and what the fees are.


## If you don’t know your annuity details

Speak to your bank or savings account provider if you don’t know who your annuity provider is. They should tell you who the payments come from – you can then contact your annuity provider to find out if it’s in your name.
