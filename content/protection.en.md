# How your pension is protected

How your pension is protected depends on your pension type.

## Defined contribution pensions

If your employer goes out of business you won’t lose your pension pot. This is because [defined contribution](/en/pension-types) pensions are usually run by pension providers, not employers.

^Some defined contribution pensions are run by a trust chosen by the employer. Contact your employer for exact compensation details.^

## If your provider can’t pay

You can be compensated for up to 100% of the value of your pot if your pension provider can’t pay you and is authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

You can claim compensation from the [Financial Services Compensation Scheme](http://www.fscs.org.uk/).

## Defined benefit pensions

These pensions are usually protect by the [Pension Protection Fund](http://www.pensionprotectionfund.org.uk/).

You’ll usually receive:

- 100% compensation if you’ve reached your ‘selected retirement age’ (the age you agreed with your pension provider to retire)
- 90% compensation if you’re below your selected retirement age

## Annuities

You can claim for up to 100% of the current value of your pot if your annuity provider can’t pay you and is authorised by the FCA.

^Contact your provider if you need to [complain about a pension](/en/pension-complaints).^
