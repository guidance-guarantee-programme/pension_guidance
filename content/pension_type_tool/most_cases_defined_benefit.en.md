# Find out your pension type

## In most cases you’ll have a defined benefit pension

Pension Wise only gives guidance on defined contribution pensions.

See our guidance on [pension investment options]({::money_helper_url path="pensions-and-retirement/building-your-retirement-pot/retirement-pot-building/pension-investment-options-an-overview.html" locale="en"/}){: target="_parent"} and the [State Pension]({::money_helper_url path="pensions-and-retirement/state-pension.html" locale="en"/}){: target="_parent"}.

^If you have more than one pension, you may also have a defined contribution pension – [check another pension]({::money_helper_url path="pensions-and-retirement/taking-your-pension/pension-wise/find-out-your-pension-type.html" locale="en"/}){: target="_parent"}.^
