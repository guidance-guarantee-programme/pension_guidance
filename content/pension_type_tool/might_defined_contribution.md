# Find out your pension type

## You might have a defined contribution pension

These are sometimes known as ‘money purchase’ pensions. The amount you get depends on how much was paid in and how well the investments have done.

There are different ways you can take your defined contribution pension pot. You can book a free [Pension Wise appointment](/appointments) to find out more.

^If you have more than one pension, you may also have a defined contribution pension – [check another pension](/pension-type-tool).^
