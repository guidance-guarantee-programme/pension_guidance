# Find out your pension type

## In most cases you’ll have a defined contribution pension

These are sometimes known as ‘money purchase’ pensions. The amount you get depends on how much was paid in and how well the investments have done.

You choose how to take money from your pension pot.

You can book a free Pension Wise appointment to talk about your options for taking your money.
