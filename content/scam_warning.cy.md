# Be aware of pension scams

Weâ€™ve received reports of customers getting unsolicited messages, calls and
visits from people claiming to be our representatives or from our sister
services The Pension Advisory Service (TPAS) and Money Advice Service (MAS).

%Pension Wise does not cold call or send unsolicited messages via email, WhatsApp or SMS%

Be cautious of any unsolicited contact as many scams involve criminals pretending to be from a genuine organisation.

You can report any suspicious contact to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 or use their [online reporting tool](https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/reporting-fraud-and-cyber-crime).
