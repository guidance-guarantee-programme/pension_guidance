## What is Pension Wise?

Pension Wise is a free and impartial government service which helps you
understand your defined contribution pension options.

The service is provided in partnership with Citizens Advice, The Pensions
Advisory Service and Teleperformance.

## Your personal data

Pension Wise collects and stores personal data for the purpose of providing you
with Pension Wise guidance, and for quality and training purposes in accordance
with the statutory requirement described in Section 333B(1) of the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000. The lawful basis for Pension Wise processing
personal data is set out in Article 6(1)(e) of the General Data Protection
Regulations as follows:

^processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller^

Your data will be shared between Pension Wise and our delivery partners
(Citizens Advice, The Pensions Advisory Service and Teleperformance) where it
is necessary for the purpose of providing you with Pension Wise guidance, for
training and quality purposes and to investigate complaints.

We won’t share your information with any other organisations for marketing or
commercial purposes, and we don’t pass on your details to other websites.

## How we use your information - booking an appointment

When you use our online booking system or call our booking phone line, you will
be asked to provide your name, telephone number, email address, date of birth,
and pension type which will be stored on our system and used for the purpose of
checking eligibility and booking you an appointment slot at your desired
time/location with one of our guidance specialists. We may use the telephone
number you provide to send you a text to remind you that your appointment is
coming up. We may also store data about any reasonable adjustments you may
require to help you to access the appointment.

If you have no further contact with Pension Wise after booking an appointment
(for example if you subsequently cancel the appointment and do not re-book),
your personal data will be stored in our booking system for a maximum of 2 years
from the date the booking was made and then deleted. Calls to our booking line
are recorded and stored for 6 months.

For eligibility webchat with the Pensions Advisory Service, your transcript is
stored for a period of 12 months before being deleted.

The lawful basis for Pension Wise processing personal data for this purpose is
set out in Article 6(1)(e) of the General Data Protection Regulations.

## How we use your information - guidance appointments

Face to face and telephone appointments are delivered through Citizens Advice,
The Pensions Advisory Service and Teleperformance.

During a Pension Wise guidance appointment questions will be asked about your
personal and family affairs, financial arrangements and plans and general state
of health to inform the discussion with the guidance specialist.

Details of these will be stored on our systems as part of the record of your
appointment.

### Personal data

The lawful basis for Pension Wise processing this data for the delivery of
appointments in conjunction with our delivery partners (the Citizens Advice
network and The Pensions Advisory Service), and storing your
data securely for a maximum of 2 years, is set out in Article 6(1)(e) of the
General Data Protection Regulations; _“performance of a task carried out in the
public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the
controller”_

For telephone appointments with the Pensions Advisory Service and Citizens
Advice, key details from your appointment are stored, and calls are recorded
and stored, for a maximum of two years before being deleted.

For appointments delivered by Citizens Advice (England and Wales), they will
ask for your consent to store key details from your appointment for a period of
six years, in line with their organisational retention policy. This is to
respond to any comments/complaints that arise within the 6 year statute of
limitation period. The lawful basis for this is set out in Article 6(1)(a) of
the General Data Protection Regulations; _“the data subject has given consent to
the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes.”_

For appointments delivered by Citizens Advice Scotland, key details from your
appointment will be stored for 6 years, in line with their organisational
retention policy. This is to respond to any comments/complaints that arise
within the 6 year statute of limitation period. The lawful basis for this is
set out in Article 6(1)(f) of the General Data Protection Regulations;
_“processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued
by the controller or by a third party except where such interests are
overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data
subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data
subject is a child.”_

Consent can be withdrawn at any time by contacting Citizens Advice directly, or
by emailing [contact@pensionwise.gov.uk](mailto:contact@pensionwise.gov.uk).

### Health data

For face-to-face appointments delivered by Citizens Advice England and Wales,
any basic health data you provide when requesting an appointment online and
during the appointment will be stored in general terms as part of the record of
appointment, where it is relevant to your pension options (for example a health
condition may entitle you to an enhanced annuity). Where this occurs,
processing and retention of this data for a maximum of 2 years is in accordance
with Article 9(2)(g) of the General Data Protection Regulations, in reference
to Schedule 1, Part 2(6)(1 and 2) of the Data Protection Act 2018.

Citizens Advice (England and Wales) will ask for your consent to store any
basic health data discussed in your appointment for a period of six years, in
line with their organisational retention policy. This consent process is in
accordance with Article 9(2)(a) of the General Data Protection Regulations.
 
Citizens Advice Scotland does not keep a written record of health data relating
to Pension Wise appointments. However, special category data that you disclose
during a telephone appointment will be stored on an audio recording for 2
years. You will be reminded of this at the start of the call and advised that
you are under no obligation to disclose any special category data.

Consent can be withdrawn at any time by contacting Citizens Advice directly, or
by emailing [contact@pensionwise.gov.uk](mailto:contact@pensionwise.gov.uk).

You will be provided with a summary of your appointment.

## How we use your information - appointment summary

After your appointment we will send you a standard document which summarises
the core content of a Pension Wise appointment. We will ask for your postal
address and/or email address to send this to you. We also use your postcode to

UK.

Pension Wise service. 

You can withdraw your consent to be contacted by Ipsos Mori at any time, by

information we process. We have described those rights and the circumstances in
which they apply below.

### Erasure

You have a right to request that we delete your personal information. Under
Article 17 of the GDPR individuals have the right to have personal data erased.

- we no longer need to process your information for the purposes for which it was provided
- we have requested your permission to process your personal information and you wish to withdraw your consent
- we are not using your information in a lawful manner

The right to erasure does not apply if processing is necessary for one of the following reasons: 

- to exercise the right of freedom of expression and information
- to comply with a legal obligation
- for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority
- for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific research historical
  research or statistical purposes where erasure is likely to render impossible
  or seriously impair the achievement of that processing

information. You may request us to restrict processing your personal
information if you believe that:

  was provided, but you require the information to establish, exercise or
  defend legal claims
- we are not using your information in a lawful manner

### Objection

In accordance with Article 21 of the General Data Protection Regulations, you
have the right to object to us processing your data. Depending on the nature of
the request, this may interfere with our ability to provide you with guidance.
For example, if you wanted a telephone appointment but objected to us using
your phone number, we would not be able to call you to conduct the appointment.
As another example, if you objected to us using both your email address and
your postal address, we would not be able to send you a confirmation of your
appointment booking, or a summary of your appointment. 

### Withdraw consent

You have a right to withdraw your consent. Where we rely on your permission to
process your personal information, you have a right to withdraw your consent at
any time. We will always make it clear where we need your permission to
