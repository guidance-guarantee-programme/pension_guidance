<p>
  Based on what you've told us, if you take your whole <%= format_currency(@calculator.pot) %>
  pension pot in one go, you could receive:

  <strong class="calculator__result__number t-pot-received"><%= format_currency(@result.pot_received) %></strong>

  after paying:

  <strong class="calculator__result__number t-pot-tax"><%= format_currency(@result.pot_tax) %> in tax</strong>
</p>

<h2>Things to note</h2>

<ol>
  <li>What you receive includes your 25% tax-free sum</li>
  <li>To work out how much tax you have to pay, your pension monies are added to your other taxable income for the year</li>
  <li>How much tax you pay will depend on your individual circumstances</li>
</ol>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
  <p>Pension payments are likely to attract emergency tax. Your provider may reimburse you
  automatically, otherwise you can claim back the extra tax yourself.</p>
