              The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/independent-case-examiner">Independent Case Examiner (ICE)</a>
              is a free and impartial service that can investigate your complaint to see whether we’ve dealt with it in the right way.
            </p>

            <div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
              <p>
                ICE will only look at your complaint after you’ve been through the full Pension Wise complaints process first.
                It can’t consider disputes about policy or legal matters.
              </p>
            </div>

            <p>
              You’ll need to send them a copy of your complaint as well as letters or emails that we sent in response.
              ICE usually won’t look at a complaint received more than 6 months after the date of our final response.
            </p>

            <p>
              You can also ask an MP to refer your complaint to the independent
              <a href="http://www.ombudsman.org.uk">Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman</a>. You can
              <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/">get help with finding your MP</a>
              if you don’t know who they are. The Ombudsman usually only looks at complaints that ICE has already reviewed.
