            Based on what you’ve told us, if you use your %{pot_value} pension pot to buy an annuity, you could get:

            <h3 class="calculator__estimate__number t-calculator-tax-free-lump-sum">%{estimate} tax free</h3>

            and get:

            <h3 class="calculator__estimate__number t-calculator-income">
              %{income} guaranteed annual taxable income, for the rest of your life
            </h3>

              You may wish to choose a joint-life annuity that pays your spouse
              or partner after you die, or an enhanced annuity which pays more
              if you smoke or have a medical condition.
