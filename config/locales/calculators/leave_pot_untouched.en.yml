              This is an estimate based on your whole pot growing at a rate of about
              %{growth_rate} per year — this may vary.
            </li>
            <li>
              The amount in your pot will be affected by inflation and any fees your provider charges.
            </li>
            <li>
              You must leave your whole pot — you can't take just the 25% tax-free lump sum and leave the rest.
