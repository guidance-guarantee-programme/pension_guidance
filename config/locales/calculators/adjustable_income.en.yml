        summary:
          html: |
            Based on what you’ve told us, if you use your %{pot_value} pension pot to take an adjustable income, you could get:

            <h3 class="calculator__estimate__number t-calculator-tax-free-lump-sum">%{estimate} tax free</h3>

            and

            <h3 class="calculator__estimate__number">
              a monthly income of <span class="calculator__highlight">%{drawdown_amount}</span>
              until you’re <span class="t-calculator-age-for-desired-income calculator__highlight">%{until_age}</span>
            </h3>

            <li class="t-calculator-life-expectancy-income">
              Average life expectancy for those aged 55 is mid-to-late 80s. A monthly income of %{monthly_income}
              could last until you’re %{until_age}, though you could live longer.

            <li>
              This is an estimate based on the amount in your pot growing at a rate of about
              %{growth_rate}% per year — this may vary.

              No allowance has been made for inflation, you may wish to consider how this will affect the buying power of this income.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you have a very large pot, your tax-free amount could be different. This depends on whether you’ve gone over the lifetime allowance (LTA), whether you’ve registered for LTA protection, whether you are liable for LTA tax charges, and whether you’ve already taken money from your pot.
