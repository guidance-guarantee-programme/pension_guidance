Feature: Calculators
  As a visitor to the website considering the 6 options
  I want to input my own numbers
  So that I can find out what the options mean to me

  Scenario Outline: Load a guide
    When I visit the <Slug> guide
    Then the calculator is displayed

    Examples:
      | Slug           |
      | take-whole-pot |
